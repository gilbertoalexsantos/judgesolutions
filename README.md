# Programming Contest Solutions
---

A small set of solutions (and pending) from the most various judges onlines.

Sometimes, you'll see similarities with others solutions in the web, principally
in harder questions. That's because when I can't solve a problem, I just go through the
web in search for a solution. After that, I try to implement myself (It's really hard to
change a lot the code after you see the solution).

If you know how to solve some pending problem, feel free to send me some clues. Or, if you're
having some trouble understanding any of my solutions, send me a email.
