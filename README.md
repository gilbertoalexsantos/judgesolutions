# Programming Contest Solutions
---

A small set of solutions (and pending) from the most various judges onlines.

Sometimes, you'll see similarities with anothers solutions in the web, principally
in harder questions. That's because when I can't solve solve, I just go through the
web and see the solution. After that, I try to implement myself (It's really hard to
change a lot the code after you see the solution).
